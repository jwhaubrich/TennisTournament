<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.topendsports.com/sport/tennis/images/tennis-tournament-pixabay.jpg)

This project was developed to simulate a tennis tournament (or a tournament of any kind). The idea is that the user can enter in how many teams are playing and how many players are on each team. After that, the user can enter in scores for each team and match until a winner has been identified through the tournament. Upon execution of the main program the user will:
1. Select how many teams will play.
2. Select how many players are on each team.
3. Matches between teams are randomly selected.
4. The user can then enter in scores for each match until a winning team is identified.
